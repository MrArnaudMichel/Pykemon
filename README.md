## Description
This is a remake of a Pokémon game. Its name is "Pokémon: Mystical Forests". Currently, the storyline is not implemented, but it will be about a world where humans did not respect the planet, and the lands have dried up. As a result of this drought, an Evil Legendary Pokémon has appeared, whose goal is to absorb the natural energy of the Earth. It will be aided by a Malevolent Team: The Phantom Brigade. The player's role will be to find the second Legendary Pokémon to save the planet.
